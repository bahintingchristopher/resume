    <p>
      My name is <strong>Christopher T. Bahinting</strong>, from <strong>Lapu-Lapu, Cebu</strong>. 
      I'm passionate about <strong>web and software development</strong>.

      I have previous work experience as an <strong>Office Staff</strong>, a <strong>CAD Operator at the National Power Corporation</strong>, 
      and a <strong>Graphic Artist at the Energy Development Corporation</strong>, where my projects mainly focused on 
      <strong>redrawing and updating as-built plans and Office works</strong>. I had also  an experience in serving as <strong>Fulltime Missionary</strong> of <strong>the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</strong> from 2005 to 2007. Also, I had the opportunity to serve as Bishop in our local unit from year 2009 to 2016 and currently serving as Cebu Temple Ordinance Worker.

    <h2>Experiences</h2>
   
    <p>As CAD Operator and Graphic Artist, I was responsible for redrawing old as-built plans using AutoCAD and Adobe Photoshop. One of the skills that help me landed the CAD operator job was my knowledge in programming, because during or on year 2003 the CAD was a command based application, No one can draw CAD except someone who has knowledge in coding.</p>

    <p>I had also  an experience in serving as <strong>Fulltime Missionary</strong> of <strong>the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</strong> from 2005 to 2007. Also, I had the opportunity to serve as Bishop in our local unit from year 2009 to 2016 and currently serving as Cebu Temple Ordinance Worker.
